Hi, I’m @mrdchua.

I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Physics at the University of the Philippines Los Baños,
where I also work as a physics instructor, teaching laboratory courses in mechanics, electromagnetism, and modern physics.

My research interests focus on applying Machine Learning to Fundamental Physics, particularly in High-Energy Physics.

Feel free to reach out to me at markruelchua@gmail.com or mdchua3@up.edu.ph.
